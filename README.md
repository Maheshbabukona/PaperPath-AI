# Mastering AI/ML: A Guided Research Paper Journey

**Live Site:** [https://maheshbabukona.github.io/PaperPath-AI/](https://maheshbabukona.github.io/PaperPath-AI/)

This project is not just a list of papers; it's a structured curriculum. Reading foundational research is the single best way to build a deep, first-principles understanding of AI. This guide is designed to take you from core mathematical principles to the cutting-edge of Generative AI, one paper at a time.

This tool is built to help you navigate that journey.

## The Learning Strategy: How to Use This Guide

This list is intentionally structured into 13 distinct phases. To gain mastery, you must build your knowledge from the ground up.

### 1. Follow the Phases Sequentially
Do not skip ahead. The phases are the most important part of this guide. You cannot understand "Phase 4: The Transformer Revolution" without first understanding "Phase 3: Sequence Models" and "Phase 2: Deep Learning Foundations." Trust the process—each phase builds the necessary context for the next.

### 2. Prioritize the 'Mandatory' Papers
This curriculum is built on a "critical path."
* **Mandatory (Red Tag):** These papers are non-negotiable. They introduced the core ideas that the entire field is built upon. If you read nothing else, read these.
* **Optional (No Tag):** These papers provide deeper context, explore interesting alternatives, or build upon the mandatory papers. Use them to solidify your understanding or explore a topic more deeply.

### 3. Use the Filters as Your Learning Tools
The filters are your primary way to customize this curriculum to your needs.

* **Filter by Topic:**
    * **For a broad understanding:** Read all papers in a phase.
    * **For specialization:** Once you have the foundations (Phases 1-4), use the `NLP`, `Computer Vision`, or `GenAI` filters to focus on a specific career track.

* **Filter by Difficulty:**
    * **If you're new:** Start by filtering for `Beginner` papers to build confidence.
    * **If you're stuck:** An `Advanced` paper might be too dense. Read the `Intermediate` papers in that phase first, then come back to the advanced one.

### 4. Track Your Progress to Stay Motivated
This is a marathon, not a sprint. These papers are dense and will take time to fully absorb.

When you click on a paper, it will open in a new tab. After you've read and (most importantly) *understood* it, the card will be marked as 'completed' (✓). Your progress is automatically saved in your browser.

Use this feature to see how far you've come and to keep yourself organized.

## A Recommended Study Method

For each paper, especially the `Mandatory` ones:

1.  **First Pass (The "What"):** Read the **Abstract**, **Introduction**, and **Conclusion**. Your goal is to answer: "What problem does this paper solve?"
2.  **Second Pass (The "How"):** Look at all the **Figures**, **Tables**, and **Diagrams**. Read their captions. This will often explain the architecture or core idea visually.
3.  **Third Pass (The "Why"):** Read the full paper from start to finish. Take notes. Try to answer: "Why did this approach work better than what came before?"
4.  **Final Step:** Mark it 'completed' in the app and move to the next one.

Good luck on your journey.
